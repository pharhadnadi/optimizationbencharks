# optimization benchmarks
Java (Netbeans) implementation of some famous optimiziation benchmarks.
Usually will be used for evaluating different optimization algorithms.

it covers the following functions:
DecomposableProblem,        
HIFF,                       HollandRoyalRoad,
knapsackZeroOne,            LongPath,
maxone,                     MPG,
MultidimensionalKnapsack,   nPeakMAXSAT,
RoyalRoad,                  Trap,
TypDecomposableProblem,     Branin function, 
ackly fucnction,            Zakharov function,
Rosenbrock function,           Trid function,
Sum Squares function,          Shekel function,
Perm function,                 Schwefel function, etc.
