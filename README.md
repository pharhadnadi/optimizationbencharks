# optimization benchmarks
Java (Netbeans) implementation of well-known optimization benchmarks. Typically used to assess various optimization algorithms.

it covers the following functions:


DecomposableProblem,        


HIFF,                       HollandRoyalRoad,


knapsackZeroOne,            LongPath,


maxone,                     MPG,


MultidimensionalKnapsack,   nPeakMAXSAT,
